# Practical Test: React-Native Mobile App

## The Challenge

Our Product Engineering team conducted some users interviews and concluded that our users enjoy collecting Pokémon. We decided to invest some time building a proof of concept to help us decide if we should do more in this area.

One of our team members recently initiated a project to develop a mobile application using React Native and [Expo](https://expo.dev/) that serves as a comprehensive Pokémon catalogue with search functionality. You have been appointed as the Product Engineer in charge of carrying this project forward.

Your goals for this task are the following:

 - Pick up where our Product Engineer left off: You are provided with the current state of the application for you to review and understand the progress made thus far.
 - Ensure Optimal Performance: As you develop, keep in mind that the application should remain responsive and performant.

## Scope

The Product Engineering team has outlined the essential features for the minimum viable product:

- **List of Pokémon**: Display a list of Pokémon ordered by their default number. Each entry must prominently feature the Pokémon's name and image. Incorporate pagination so the user can browse the entire catalogue without overwhelming the interface.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a responsive search function that offers users the convenience of finding Pokémon by name.

Use the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) to fetch the Pokémon data.

### Guidelines

In assessing your submission for the take-home exercise, we will focus on architecture and performance. Key evaluation criteria include the separation of concerns, React Native patterns, and effective use of the provided API. While unit tests are not an absolute requirement for this exercise, their inclusion would be considered a plus. Please be aware that the initial codebase was constructed under time constraints and may exhibit technical imperfections. Addressing and refactoring these areas of technical debt is **not mandatory** for this exercise. However, we welcome and value any enhancements you choose to make.

While a fully refined user interface is not our expectation, we place significant emphasis on the user experience. As a potential Product Engineer on our team, we trust your discretion regarding the incorporation of third-party libraries. Feel free to exercise autonomous decision-making throughout this process. We look forward to delving into your thought process during a subsequent discussion.

### Estimated Time

We expect this to take you 3-4 hours. **Please do not spend more than 6 hours.**

*Note: It's essential to prioritize quality over quantity. If you find that you are unable to complete all the features within the given timeframe, please do not spend more than the advised hours. This a practical test and the value of your time is the priority one. Instead, in a separate text file, list out the features or improvements that you would have implemented given more time.*

## Setup
Clone this repository and run these commands:

`npm install`

`npx expo start`
 
You can use [ExpoGo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/) with any iOS or Android device.

## Submission

Although it's not compulsory, we highly value the submission of a concise document accompanying your project. This document should encapsulate the rationale behind your design choices, any obstacles you encountered and overcame, and any additional insights you believe are pertinent to the understanding of your work.

Upon completion of the project to your satisfaction, please forward a download link for the project to the HR representative who initially reached out to you. To maintain the confidentiality of your solution, please refrain from initiating a pull request in this repository. We greatly appreciate your cooperation and discretion in this matter. Thank you in advance.
